This github contains the following files:

- "Descriptive Analysis.ipynb" which introduce the features of our dataset.
- "train.py" which allows to train a random Forest or a Boosting model.
- "Adversarial Validation.ipynb" containing the code we used to check the similary between our trainset and the test set of Kaggle.
- "Interpretability.ipynb" which helps us to understand the most importance features of our model.


To run the code, you need to follow the instructions below:
