# Defi-IA-2023
This repository contains all codes, data and information regarding the AI challenge 2023. The goal of the challenge was to predict prices hotels.

## Repository
This github contains the following files:

- `data_analysis.ipynb` which introduce the features of our dataset, and performs a preliminary analysis on the data,
- `train.py` which allows to train a random Forest or a Boosting model,
- `adversarial_validation.ipynb` and its python file `adversarial_validation.py`containing the code we used to check the similary between our trainset and the test set of Kaggle,
- `interpretability.ipynb` which helps us to understand the most importance features of our model,
- `gradio_app.py`, which launch the gradio application,
- `test.py`, which test the model on Kaggle test set,
- `Dockerfile`, which contains the information of the Dockerfile,
- a file `data` containing datasets for train, improved dataset, the test set and the hotel features. 


To run the code, you need to follow the instructions below:
